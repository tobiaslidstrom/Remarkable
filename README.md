Remarkable
=============
Remarkable is a CSS stylesheet for standardizing and resetting default styles. This should make your stylesheets for various projects look more clean and give you a better overview. Remarkable comes with some hacks to workaround common issues in browsers.

Usage
-------------------
Remarkable comes with two stylesheet files; `remarkable-min.css` and `remarkable.css`. The `remarkable-min.css` is a compressed file and the other includes all comments, whitespace and so on. It's recommended to use the compressed version for faster load times.

Add this line to your `<head>` tag. Should be loaded before other stylesheets.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="remarkable.css" media="all" />
```
